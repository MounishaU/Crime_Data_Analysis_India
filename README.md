# India Crime Analysis Project
 Exploring crime trends, hotspots and victim demographics in India(2020-2024).
## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive data analysis of simulated crime data in India from 2020 to 2024. The primary aim was to identify key trends,geographical hotspots, prevalent crime types and victime demographics to gain actionable insights into crime patterns.
## Data Source
The analysis is based on a simulated dataset containing various crime records, including date of occurrence,city,crime description,victim gender and victim age
## Tools used
* **SQL(DB Browser for SQLite)**: for database management ,data extraction and initial data aggregation.
* **Microsoft Excel:** for data cleaning, data summarizations and creating visualizations.
* **Microsoft PowerPoint:** for creating a professional presentation to communicate key findings. 
## Key Findings
* **Yearly Trends:** Overall crime showed a notable decrease in 2024, after a period of stability from 2020-2023.
* **Geographical Hotspots:** Delhi and Mumbai reported the highest overall crime volumes in the dataset.
